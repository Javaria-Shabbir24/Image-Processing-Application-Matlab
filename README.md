# **Image Processing Assignment: GUI-based Image Manipulation Application**

## Objective
The goal of this assignment is to develop a GUI-based application that enables users to perform basic image processing tasks in MATLAB. The GUI will allow users to load, manipulate, and save images in various formats. The application will also display important information about the images and provide several image processing features.

## Requirements

### 1. GUI Components

- **Browse**:  
  A button to load an image from the system.
  
- **Save Image**:  
  A radio button or dropdown list to select and save the image in formats like:
  - `.jpg`
  - `.png`
  - `.bmp`
  - `.tiff`
  
- **Image Info**:  
  A button to display detailed image information including:
  - Height and Width
  - Format
  - Original File Size
  - Compressed File Size
  - Compression Ratio

---

### 2. Image Processing Operations

- **Convert Grayscale to Black and White**:  
  Add a slider for adjusting the threshold dynamically when converting a grayscale image to black and white.

- **Crop the Image**:  
  Provide options to crop a selected portion of the image.

- **Resize the Image**:  
  Allow users to resize the image while maintaining the aspect ratio.

- **Flip the Image**:  
  Options to flip the image either:
  - Vertically
  - Horizontally

- **Combine Two Images**:  
  Allow users to combine two images either:
  - Side-by-side
  - Overlay

- **Custom Compression**:  
  Allow users to choose custom compression levels (e.g., when saving as `.jpg`).


### Summary
This assignment aims to provide a user-friendly interface for performing fundamental image manipulation tasks. With the listed features, the application will offer a variety of tools for processing and saving images efficiently.
